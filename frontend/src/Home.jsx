            <p className="mt-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-sm">
              ‚ÄùBy the turn of the 21st century, the world was moving towards a
              bright future. Quantum computing in the 2010s created faster
              computers worldwide. Medical nanites in 2013 sped up recovery
              rates and cured diseases previously incurable. And PMCs became
              legitimate businesses under the UN to establish security and peace
              worldwide. It should have been a golden age, a time of rapid human
              technological development."
              <br />
              <br />
              ‚ÄùHowever, in 2016 everything would fall apart. The largest solar
              flare in recorded history hit the earth. Satellites, Internet,
              GPS, everything connecting the world was flung into the abyss of
              space or fried, starting what was dubbed on remnants of social
              media as ‚ÄòThe Crash‚Äô. Within the first week alone, the death toll
              spiraled into the hundreds of thousands from just the loss of
              vital infrastructure such as hospitals, emergency services, food,
              and water. Within the first month, dozens of countries dissolved
              into failed states. In the first year, civil unrest due to lack of
              supply wracked whatever countries still stood. By the end of the
              year, soldiers and contractors left behind in hot-zones turned
              into warlords and mercenaries for their own survival. Taking
              contracts and jobs from underground fixers in exchange for basic
              necessities.
              <br />
              <br />
              ‚ÄùTwo years later, whatever global hegemons had existed were
              shattered. In it‚Äôs wake, a rising China expanded into southeast
              Asia, and a waning NATO struggled to get on its feet. One by one,
              from Mongolia, to Taiwan, to Pakistan, they fell into Chinese
              orbit accepting aid to rebuild in the absence of the US. Chinese
              vessels sit in the ports of Cambodia and Singapore, while warships
              poise themselves to strike deeper south off the coast of Australia
              and New Zealand.‚Äù

              Developed with inspiration from the likes of Battlefield, Modern
              Warfare, Rainbow Six, and Ghost Recon, Calamari strips down the
              cumbersome mechanics of other tabletops into simple add [x] and
              subtract [y], with a heavy emphasis on stacking the odds in your
              favor before you execute. Every roll is lethal, thresholds are
              low, and oftentime, one roll can mean the difference of life and
              death.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-100">
              Character creation is even easier, as our companion
              auto-calculates information based off of your input, and with
              classes coming with pre-determined skillsets it's just a matter of
              distributing a few extra points, choosing your gear and gadgets,
              and jumping into a session.

              Similar to DnD, but different, Players get to choose specific
              equipment and weapons as their items and gear. From high powered
              railguns to advanced combat drones, each class brings something to
              the table with the set of gear and equipment assigned to each.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-100">
              All classes have specific subclasses and then gameplay subsets
              within them. Such as Assault consisting of the Raider and Rifleman
              subclasses, or Engineer with specializing into Combat engineering
              and Anti-tank or Technical engineering with drone warfare.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-100">
              And with earning skill points and currency consistently, you're
              never stagnating and stuck with a certain set of equipment unless
              the DM decides so. Not to mention modding and homebrew support for
              custom gadgets and ideas.
