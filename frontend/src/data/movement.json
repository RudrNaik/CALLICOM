As such, you suffer a malus depending on distance travelled to all actions done while flanking per movement rules. However- when flanking a target or a piece of cover, you negate any cover bonuses they may have. \n\nTo determine if a target is being flanked, draw imaginary lines from the hexe faces of adjacent cover. If the shooter is in hexes behind those lines, then they are considered being flanked."
