When prone or mounted, you cannot move to sprint immediately, but can just move normally.\n\n You make little noise while prone, and can easily sneak under vehicles and into vents if need be.\n\n However, you also suffer a -3 to all [CQC] and [Melee] rolls, and a -2 to all movement related rolls [Acrobatics] in both stances."

As such, you suffer a malus depending on distance travelled to all actions done while flanking per movement rules. However- when flanking a target or a piece of cover, you negate any cover bonuses they may have. \n\nTo determine if a target is being flanked, draw imaginary lines from the hex faces of adjacent cover outwards of the target. If the shooter is in hexes behind those lines, then they are considered being flanked."
