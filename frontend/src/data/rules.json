No Margin of Success is determined; instead the combatant with the highest result will act first. The next highest will act second and so on for the remaining combatants in decreasing order. Those with tied results act simultaneously. \n\n Any character who fumbles the test is confused for a moment by the panic and chaos of the situation and cannot begin to perform any action except duck or running for cover — but he may continue any action that began in a previous round and requires more than a round (e.g. treating a wounded buddy). Characters that have rolled 6+ on their Initiative test may perform two actions. \n\n In an ambush, or from stealth, only attackers roll initiative as they will fire first no matter what. When conducting a sync-shot, players who roll 6+ on their initiative test can also aim for another target if they wish because of their increased focus."

If you are crawling or prone, you may not sprint next round. \n\n Walking/Normal movement means that the character is moving at a somewhat hurried pace, able to rapidly change direction and otherwise react to the environment. \n\n Sprinting is an all-out run, with the character giving everything he’s got.

The attacker chooses an area (up to 5-meters wide or specifically suppressing a piece of cover), then rolls their attack normally. Record the result and add 2 to it: that’s the Saturation Fire Threshold.\n\n Anyone or anything which enters that saturated zone later during the combat round must beat the Saturation Threshold or take damage. If the defender fails, the Margin of Failure is multiplied by the Damage Multiplier of the weapon and the resulting damage is treated as usual. \n\nIf the defender is already in the suppressed zone before the attack and under cover, they cannot move this round unless they first pass a Spirit Attribute test against a Threshold of 4.\n\n Attackers can augment the size of the area affected by spreading the projectiles around or splitting between various pieces of cover. This doubles the width of the area affected, but divides the Saturation Fire Threshold in half (rounded up). \n\n There are two limitations to Saturation fire: the saturation zone must be within the medium range or closer and the weapon will consume twice the amount of ammo per turn until it's stopped.
