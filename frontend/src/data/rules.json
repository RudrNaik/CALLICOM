Those with tied results act simultaneously. \n\n Any character who fumbles the test is confused for a moment by the panic and chaos of the situation and cannot begin to perform any action except duck or running for cover — but he may continue any action that began in a previous round and requires more than a round (e.g. treating a wounded buddy).

These attributes contribute to your derived attributes, and can drastically change how hardy, aware, mentally sound, or brave someone is when in a firefight.\n\n These attributes are also used in specific rolls, notably when reacting to danger. They are as follows \n\n>Alertness: How aware you innately are of your surroundings. Catch people sneaking up on you, or things in the environment that arent what they should be. \n>Body: How hardy and healthy you are. Resist drugs, take harder hits, and fight off illness. \n>Intelligence: How good your intuition is. Logic your way through problems, reason your way to the most probable solution. \n>Spirit: How strong your will is. Fight on in the face of death, have grit and courage even when everything is hitting the fan. \n\n To improve attributes, you need 40 EXP, and a way that they improved that attribute. Occasionally, if a character completes an arc and the GM allows, a character can improve an attribute that way."

        "description": "When initiative is rolled with Combat Sense, and depending on party size, a GM can communicate with their party and choose to couple turns. Essentially, two or more people make their turns at once depending on the initiative queue. They can be considered 'battle buddies' but you dont have to follow that rule specifically. \n\n When turns are coupled, the initative queue is created as normal, but the GM can couple player and enemy turns together if they are adjacent so they happen at the same time. Players can organize amongst themselves to have things happen in a specific order to get certain effects."

        "description": "In grand operations, maps are much bigger, and encounters are spread across long distances a team needs to trek. These maps are also in a hex grid like others, however- they also now include specific areas marked in different colored hexes that require specific checks to pass, and will increase travel time upon success or failure. To move from one hex to another, it is 1 world tick. \n\n>Yellow [inclune/downslope]: Requires an endurance check. upon failure, travel time doubles. Even number inclines in a row have the other half as downslope, odd number inclines are all uphill or downhill. You can lose or break gear here \n>Orange [Climb]: Requires a climb check. Upon failure of the climb per climb rules, travel time doubles, but you also can mark wounds here if you fall.\n>Blue [Water]: Requires an athletics if passing through only one hex. 2+ adjacent requires endurance for each hex, with a malus of -1 per each. Failure doubles travel time.\n>Green [Dense]: Requires navigate and alertness. is considered dense forest/dense urban, can be used to hide from drones and vehicles. Vehicles will have 3 times the travel time through these areas upon a failed navigate check."

Depending on the vehicle commandeered, a team can move a much longer distance in a short amount of time. However- there are limitations. \n\n >Light Vehicles [RSOV][LNDCRUSR][RZR]: Move four hexes instead of 1. Can traverse dense terrain but travel speed reduces to normal. Provides little protection if caught in an ambush. \n>Medium Vehicles [HMMWV][MRAP][JLTV]: Move two hexes instead of 1, can traverse dense terrain but travel speed reduces to normal. Provides protection if caught in an ambush, hit a mine, or more.\n >Heavy Vehicles [M1A2 SEPV2][M3A2 IFV][LAV-88]: Move at the same speed as normal. Cannot traverse dense terrain. Provides impeccable protection, firepower, and more in a fight. \n\n All vehicles are immune to endurance checks. Certain vehicles that are amphibious like BMPs or LAVs can cross water without endurance or athletics checks. No vehicles can traverse mountainous terrain."
